# Studio Business Boilerplate

**A boiler plate for a small design studio, one to three employees. This includes my prefered choices for a CRM, invoicing, accounting, time tracking, etc.**

Eventually I will expand this to web presence, which will include ecommerce solutions and social media pressence.

This is the stack that we use at [Quite Type](http://quitetype.com/)

## Table of contents

- [Method of Selection](#method-of-selection)
- [CRM](#crm)
- [Accounting & Invoicing](#accounting-&-invoicing)

## Method of Selection

**Each section follows the following formula:**
- Selected solution
- Cost
- Explanation & drawbacks
- Other solutions in order of alternatives

## CRM

### Hub Spot

**Price:** <br>
FREE

**Why:** <br>
[Hub Spot](http://www.hubspot.com/) is free and all the features I really need are to track client emails and relationships.

**Alternatives:**
-  [Salesforce](http://Salesforce.com)
-  [Infusionsoft](http://Infusionsoft.com/)
-  [Pipedrive](http://Pipedrive.com/)
-  [Freshdesk](http://Freshdesk.com/)
-  [Prophet](http://Prophet.com/)


## Accounting & Invoicing

### Quick Books

**Price:** <br>
$13.00 / MONTH

**Why:** <br>
The bottom line is [Quickbooks](http://www.Quickbooks.com/) has all the features I AND my rarely used accountant need. It also isn't very expensive and could scale affordably. I would like to use a free service like wave â€” but it doesn't have all the features I need, even as a small studio. 

**Alternatives:**
-  [Freshbooks](http://Freshbooks.com/)
-  [Wave](http://waveapps.com/)
-  [Brightbook](http://Brightbook.com/)
-  [Xero](http://Xero.com/)
