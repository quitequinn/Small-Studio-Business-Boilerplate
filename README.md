# Studio Business Boilerplate

**A boiler plate for a small design studio, one to three employees. This includes my prefered choices for a CRM, invoicing, accounting, time tracking, etc.**

Eventually I will expand this to web presence, which will include ecommerce solutions and social media pressence.

This is the stack that we use at [Quite Type](http://quitetype.com/)

## Method of Selection

**Each section follows the following formula:**
- Selected solution
- Cost
- Explanation & drawbacks
- Other solutions in order of alternatives


## Accounting & Invoicing

### Quick Books

**Price:** <br>
$13.00 / MONTH

**Why:** <br>
The bottom line is [Quickbooks](http://www.Quickbooks.com/) has all the features I AND my rarely used accountant need. It also isn't very expensive and could scale affordably. I would like to use a free service like wave â€” but it doesn't have all the features I need, even as a small studio. 

**Alternatives:**
-  [Wave](http://waveapps.com/)
-  [Freshbooks](http://Freshbooks.com/)
-  [Xero](http://Xero.com/)
-  [Brightbook](http://Brightbook.com/)



## CRM

### Hub Spot

**Price:** <br>
FREE

**Why:** <br>
[Hub Spot](http://www.hubspot.com/) is free and all the features I really need are to track client emails and relationships.

**Alternatives:**
-  [Salesforce](http://Salesforce.com)
-  [Infusionsoft](http://Infusionsoft.com/)
-  [Pipedrive](http://Pipedrive.com/)
-  [Freshdesk](http://Freshdesk.com/)
-  [Prophet](http://Prophet.com/)



## Messaging

### Slack

**Price:** <br>
FREE

**Why:** <br>
Honestly [Slack](http://www.slack.com/) isn't the only messaging software we use. We use Hangouts, Skype, ScreenHero, Facebook, whatever works for whoever is collaberating with us.. but it is nice to have an in house messaging platform and Slack fills that role.

**Alternatives:** <br>
I don't even know of any others.



## Project Management

### Asana

**Price:** <br>
FREE up to 15 users

**Why:** <br>
I like how [Asana](http://www.asana.com/) is organized. It feels more goal orientated. It has all the features that basecamp has plus the new design is great.

**Alternatives:**
-  [Basecamp](http://Basecamp.com/)
-  [Trello](http://trello.com/)
-  [Wrike](http://.com/)
-  [Freedcamp](http://.com/)



## Time Tracking

### Toggl

**Price:** <br>
FREE up to 5 users

**Why:** <br>
[Toggl](http://www.toggl.com/) is free and integrates into Asana. It records time. End of story.

**Alternatives:**
-  [Harvest](http://havest.com/)
-  [Hours](https://www.hourstimetracking.com/)
-  [Tracking Time](http://trackingtime.com/)
-  [Timely App](http://timelyapp.com/)
