# Studio Business Boilerplate

A boiler plate for a small design studio, one to three employees. This includes my prefered choices for a CRM, invoicing, accounting, time tracking, etc.

Eventually I will expand this to web presence, which will include ecommerce solutions and social media pressence.

This is the stack that we use at [Quite Type](http://quitetype.com/)
